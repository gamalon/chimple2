Chimple is a tool for performing inference on generative models.
The goal is to allow users to build complex models quickly: the user writes
simple code to specify a model, while Chimple performs automatic inference
under the hood.

Chimple is open source and can be accessed on Github

where any pull requests or bug reports should be sent.

\section{Installation}

\subsection{Requirements}
In order to use Chimple, you need:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Java 1.7+
   \item Matlab (if you want to use the Matlab wrapper).
\end{itemize}

Chimple has only been tested on Mac OS X and Windows operating systems
and for the interactive development environments (IDEs) Eclipse and IntelliJ.
We recommend using one of these environments after cloning the repository:
\begin{verbatim}
   git clone https://github.com/gamelanlabs/chimple2.git
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Instructions for Eclipse}
For ease of use, we have included a Python script you can run to set your
classpath properly:

In order to write a Chimple program, the user writes a program
corresponding to a generative model.
