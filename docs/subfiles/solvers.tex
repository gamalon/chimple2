\chapter{Chimple Solvers}

In Section \ref{priorsolver}, we showed how to write a probabilistic program in
Chimple and how to generate data from it.
Though it is possible to run a different solver than \texttt{PriorSolver}, such
as the \texttt{MetropolisHastingsSolver}, by simply writing a Chimple program
as shown in Section \ref{priorsolver}.

Now we discuss how to perform inference using observed data values.
